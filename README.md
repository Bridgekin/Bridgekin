## Problem
Sales teams don't have a easy way to tell who their teammates know. Understanding the impact of warm introductions, sales teams prioritize a connection through a teammate in order to drive sales

## Solution
Build a social graph of a team's contacts by enriching contact upload from sources like LinkedIn, Gmail, etc (future).

## Getting Started
A. Setup Repo

1. First, run your backend server by running ```rails s```
2. Next a seperate terminal tab
