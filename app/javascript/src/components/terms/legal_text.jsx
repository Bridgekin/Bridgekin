When users indicate interest through the platform, they are connected to one another to further explore the opportunities.  The connection is not considered a serious expression of interest.

//
// 14. Legal Disputes
// PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND WILL HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON HOW CLAIMS YOU AND BRIDGEKIN HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED.
// You and Bridgekin agree that any claim or dispute at law or equity that has arisen, or may arise, between you and Bridgekin that relates in any way to or arises out of this or previous versions of this User Agreement, your use of or access to the Services, the actions of Bridgekin or its agents, or any products or services sold or purchased through the Services, will be resolved in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Legal Disputes Section.
//
// A. Applicable Law
// You agree that, except to the extent inconsistent with or preempted by federal law, the laws of the State of California, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern this User Agreement and any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and Bridgekin, except as otherwise stated in this User Agreement.
//
// B. Agreement to Arbitrate
// You and Bridgekin each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen, or may arise, between you and Bridgekin (including any disputes or claims between you and a third-party agent of Bridgekin) that relate in any way to or arise out of this or previous versions of the User Agreement, or your use of or access to the Services, the actions of Bridgekin or its agents, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court. Alternatively, you may assert your claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate.
// 1. Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief
// YOU AND BRIDGEKIN AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, OR REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND BRIDGEKIN AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER USERS. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court, subject to your and Bridgekin’s right to appeal the court's decision. All other claims will be arbitrated.
// 2. Arbitration Procedures
// Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual. An arbitrator should apply the terms of the User Agreement as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitrate, or the interpretation of Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (“Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief”), shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide.
//
// The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The AAA’s rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The use of the word “arbitrator” in this provision shall not be construed to prohibit more than one arbitrator from presiding over an arbitration; rather, the AAA’s rules will govern the number of arbitrators that may preside over an arbitration conducted under this Agreement to Arbitrate.
//
// A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to Bridgekin should be sent to Bridgekin Inc., Attn: Litigation Department, Re: Notice of Dispute, 2694 Sacramento St. Apt. 6 San Francisco, CA 94115. Bridgekin will send any Notice to you to the physical address we have on file associated with your Bridgekin account; it is your responsibility to keep your physical address up to date. The Notice must provide a description of the nature and basis of the claims the party is asserting and the relief sought.
//
// If you and Bridgekin are unable to resolve the claims described in the Notice within 30 days after the Notice is sent, you or Bridgekin may initiate arbitration proceedings. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA’s site at www.adr.org. In addition to filing this form with the AAA in accordance with its rules and procedures, the party initiating the arbitration must mail a copy of the completed form to the opposing party. You may send a copy to Bridgekin at the following address: 2694 Sacramento St. Apt. 6, San Francisco, CA 94115. In the event Bridgekin initiates an arbitration against you, it will send a copy of the completed form to the physical address we have on file associated with your Bridgekin account. Any settlement offer made by you or Bridgekin shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.
//
// The arbitration hearing shall be held in the county of San Francisco. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or Bridgekin may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and Bridgekin subject to the arbitrator’s discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. In cases where an in-person hearing is held, you and/or Bridgekin may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.
//
// The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same Bridgekin user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
// 3. Costs of Arbitration
// Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate. Each parties will bear their own filing, administrative and arbitrator fees; provided, however, where the fees apply to both parties equally but have not been apportioned to each party, the parties will equally split the fees.
// 4. Severability
// With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (“Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief”), if an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply.
// 5. Opt-Out Procedure
// IF YOU ARE A NEW USER OF OUR SERVICES, YOU CAN CHOOSE TO REJECT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE (“OPT-OUT”) BY MAILING US A WRITTEN OPT-OUT NOTICE (“OPT-OUT NOTICE”). THE OPT-OUT NOTICE MUST BE POSTMARKED NO LATER THAN 30 DAYS AFTER THE DATE YOU ACCEPT THE USER AGREEMENT FOR THE FIRST TIME. YOU MUST MAIL THE OPT-OUT NOTICE TO BRIDGEKIN INC., ATTN: LITIGATION DEPARTMENT, RE: OPT-OUT NOTICE, 2694 Sacramento St. Apt. 6, San Francisco, CA 94115.
//
// The Opt-Out Notice must provide your name, address (including street address, city, state and zip code), and the user ID(s) and email address(es) associated with the Bridegkin Service account(s) to which the opt-out applies. You must sign the Opt-Out Notice for it to be effective. This procedure is the only way you can opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate. If you opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate, all other parts of this User Agreement and its Legal Disputes Section will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Agreement to Arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with us.
// 6. Future Amendments to the Agreement to Arbitrate
// Notwithstanding any provision in the User Agreement to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any amendment to this Agreement to Arbitrate (other than an amendment to any notice address) in the future, that amendment shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against Bridgekin prior to the effective date of the amendment. The amendment shall apply to all other disputes or claims governed by the Agreement to Arbitrate that have arisen or may arise between you and Bridgekin. We will notify you of amendments to this Agreement to Arbitrate by posting the amended terms on www.bridgekin.com at least 30 days before the effective date of the amendments and by providing notice through the Bridgekin messaging and/or by email. If you do not agree to these amended terms, you may close your account within the 30-day period and you will not be bound by the amended terms.
//
// C. Judicial Forum for Legal Disputes
// Unless you and we agree otherwise, in the event that the Agreement to Arbitrate above is found not to apply to you or to a particular claim or dispute, either as a result of your decision to opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate or as a result of a decision by the arbitrator or a court order, you agree that any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and Bridgekin must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in San Francisco. You and Bridgekin agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within San Francisco for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.
//
// 15. General
