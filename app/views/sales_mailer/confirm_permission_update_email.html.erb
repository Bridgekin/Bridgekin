<p>Hi <%= @recipient.fname.capitalize %>,</p>

<p><%= @origin_name.capitalize %> would like to update access to each other's contacts. They would like to change access from <%= @old_rel %> to <%= @new_rel %>.

<p>Click <%= link_to 'here', "#{root_url}api/confirm_invite_update?code=#{@sales_invite.link_code}" %> to confirm this change.</p>

<p>Note** No change will be made until confirmed</p>
